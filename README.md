# Not With a Bang Bot

This Twitter bot programmatically quote-tweets tweets that include the phrase "not with a bang," a memeable unit of language that comes from T.S. Eliot's poem "The Hollow Men."

Because I do not wish to expose anyone to potentially unwanted public scrutiny, I programmed the bot to only retweet tweets that have more than 100 retweets or that were tweeted by Twitter accounts with more than 10,000 followers.
